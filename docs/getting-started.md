# Overview

The Astar documentation portal serves as the official repository of current information and source of truth for everything related to the Astar Ecosystem. Astar is a interoperable smart contract platform providing native access to the Polkadot and Ethereum networks through its Layer 2 zkEVM and Substrate Parachain, and other networks plugged into Polygon AggLayer. The Astar tech stack empowers developers with the freedom to choose the network environment(s) that best suits the needs of their users and decentralised applications.
