Here you will find some common services available to developers building dApps on Astar Network, including sample configurations, and guides for many important elements of our infrastructure. For zkEVM-specific integrations please visit [this section](/docs/build/build-on-layer-2/integrations/index.md).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
