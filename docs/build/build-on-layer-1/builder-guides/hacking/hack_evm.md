# Hack EVM Smart Contracts

<Figure src={require('/docs/build/img/gradient2.jpg').default } width="100%" /> 

Read the linked chapters or use tutorials to be able to answer following questions:

## Setup MetaMask and Remix
* Did you install and connect your MetaMask to Shibuya? Which `Chain Id` did you use to setup Shibuya Network in MetaMask?
* Connect to browser IDE Remix using this [tutorial](/docs/build/build-on-layer-1/builder-guides/astar_features/use_remix.md)
* Does your environment look like this:

<Figure src={require('./img/custom_net.png').default } width="400px" />

* Can you say what does `Custom (81) network` mean?
* Deploy and test smart contract from Remix tutorial.
* What is the contract's address?
* Can you find ABI for the contract?

## Start using Solidity
<Figure src={require('./img/zombie.png').default } width="100%" />

Since it's inception, Solidity has become mainstream language for smart contract development. There are many good tutorials to start learning Solidity and one of the popular places is [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/).

## Setup Hardhat and Truffle
The Truffle and Hardhat are preferred tools to develop, deploy and test smart contract. For this guide we will pick Hardhat.
Setup your Hardhat environment using [How to use Hardhat to deploy on Shibuya](/docs/build/build-on-layer-1/builder-guides/astar_features/use_hardhat.md).
