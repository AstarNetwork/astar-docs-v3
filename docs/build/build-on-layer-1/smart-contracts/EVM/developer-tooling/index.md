# Developer Tooling

Deploying and interacting with EVM-based smart contracts on Astar is as easy as any other EVM-compatible network. Getting started requires just two steps:

1. Configuring (and funding) your Ethereum account on the respective network.
2. Adding Astar networks to your Ethereum client.

:::caution
For Astar and Shiden applications, we _highly_ recommend running your own network node and not relying on our RPC endpoints. This further decentralizes the network, and puts you in control of your uptime requirements.
