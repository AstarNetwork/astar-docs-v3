## Which network should you deploy on?

[INSERT_LAYER1_CLOUD&BUTTON] [INSERT_LAYER2_CLOUD&BUTTON] \\ Note: these two images should display the main benefits of deploying on either our Layer 1 or Layer 2 networks. let's visualize the features listed (below and) in the following sections and make developers choose which network to build on right here.

Build2Earn - Only on Layer 1
Astar network's innovative Build2Earn program allows developers to earn a basic income while they build out their products and communities. Users are able to support projects by staking on them, which adds to the passive income developers earn and forms the basis of an unstoppable grant. Build2Earn encourages projects to stand out and provide value directly to end-users. See the dApp staking section for more information.
